Portable-JDK
============

The main batch script is cable of converting any oracle JDK installation executable into a portable JDK folder by extracting the necessary files and renaming them into the proper names. This is useful for those who want to maintain a cleaner environment without having to create registry entries and shortcuts, yet still achieve the same functionality of a full JDK installation.
